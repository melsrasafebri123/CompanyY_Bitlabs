## 1. Case Overview
In order to evaluate the previously-launched initiatives, you need to write as SQL script to conduct several analyses. Some of additional informations you might need based on our previous Annual People Analytics Report:
- We successfully retained 95,75% of our employees from the beginning of 2009 by the end of 2010.
- From 2009 to 2010, our number of employees grew by 1,5%
## 2. Dataset
There are 2 datasets that i can't give you because it's forbidden by the company: 
- bitlabs-dab.I-CID-05.employees_2011
- bitlabs-dab.I-CID-05.employees_2011
## 3. File Description
### a. [retentionRate.sql](https://github.com/melsrasafebri123/CompanyY_Bitlabs/blob/main/retentionRate.sql)
Calculate our Employee Retention Rate from 2010 to 2011 by dividing the total number of active employees at the end of 2011 with the total number of employees from the beginning of 2010. Compare the number with our previous retention rate 2009 to 2010. 
### b. [growthRate.sql](https://github.com/melsrasafebri123/CompanyY_Bitlabs/blob/main/growthRate.sql)
Calculate our Company Growth Rate from 2010 to 2011 by dividing the total number of active employees at the end of 2011 with the total number of active employees from the end of 2010. Compare the number with our previous growth rate from 2009 to 2010.
### c. [rewardEligible.sql](https://github.com/melsrasafebri123/CompanyY_Bitlabs/blob/main/rewardEligible.sql)
Weâ€™re going to launch a new tenure-based reward program in 2012. Only those who stayed until the end of 2011 will be eligible for this program. Calculate the total budget that we will have to allocate for this program with details as stated below (p.s. Each employee will be categorized into based on their tenure by the time the 2011 data was recorded).
1. Tenure group 0 - 5 years: $100 / person
2. Tenure group 6 - 10 years: $200 / person
3. Tenure group 11 - 15 years: $300 / person
4. Tenure group 15 years & above: $500 / person
### d. [ageGroup.sql](https://github.com/melsrasafebri123/CompanyY_Bitlabs/blob/main/ageGroup.sql)
In terms of hiring, we wanted to ensure that we maintain roughly equal number of male & female active employees across age group:
1. Below 30 years
2. 31 - 40 years
3. 41 - 50 years
4. 51 - 60 years
5. 60 years and above
### e. [top3DeptCity.sql](https://github.com/melsrasafebri123/CompanyY_Bitlabs/blob/main/top3DeptCity.sql)
To make an informed decision in regards to manpower planning, figure out what are the Top 3 Department & City in terms of hiring (based on number of new joiners).
