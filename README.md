Weâ€™re going to launch a new tenure-based reward program in 2012. Only those who stayed until the end of 2011 will be eligible for this program. Calculate the total budget that we will have to allocate for this program with details as stated below (p.s. Each employee will be categorized into based on their tenure by the time the 2011 data was recorded).
1. Tenure group 0 - 5 years: $100 / person
2. Tenure group 6 - 10 years: $200 / person
3. Tenure group 11 - 15 years: $300 / person

In terms of hiring, we wanted to ensure that we maintain roughly equal number of male & female active employees across age group:
1. Below 30 years
2. 31 - 40 years
3. 41 - 50 years
4. 51 - 60 years
5. 60 years and above
